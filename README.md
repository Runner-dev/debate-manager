# ModelUN Debate Manager

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Main Features
- Speaker list management

- Live-sync to all users
- Delegates can independently add and remove themselves from the speaker list
- Delegates can share documents to all other participants
- Delegates can raise motions or points through the website
- Delegates can vote in parallel through the website

## Background
This website was developed for my school's one day Model UN conference (called Debatendo). The purpose was to help the new chairs manage the debate more efficently, especially considering we needed to fit double the number of people as before
